        <h1>Why Keep Cats ?</h1>
        <ul class="catpoints">
            <li class="catpoints-li"><h3>Cats can bathe themselves</h3>
            <p>
                Cats are clean pretty much 100 percent of the time. That means you never have to take the time out of
            </p>
            <p>
                your day to perform the somewhat painstaking task of washing and grooming your cat.
            </p>
        </li>

            <li class="catpoints-li"><h3>Cats will keep your house and yard rodent-free</h3>
                <p>If you are not a fan of rats, chipmunk, voles or mice in your home, owning a cat will take care of that</p> 
                <p>right away. Your cat may even bring you its prize to make you proud!</p>
            </li>
            <li class="catpoints-li">
                <h3>Cats are low-maintenance and independent</h3>
                <p>If you think you do not have the time or energy to own a pet, then a cat could be perfect for you.</p> 
               <p>Taking care of a cat requires less responsibility than some other animals.
               Those who have full-time jobs</p>  
               <p>can rest easy, knowing that their kitty can take care of itself for the most part. And when you do have extra</p>
                <p>time, cuddling up with your cat will feel better than ever.</p> 
            </li>
            <li class="catpoints-li"><h3>Cats are an eco-friendly pet choice</h3>
                <p>Living a “green” lifestyle can be difficult, but a cat is a great choice for potential pet owners looking to</p> 
               <p> stay eco-friendly. Studies show that the lifetime resources needed to feed and care for a cat have a</p>
                <p>smaller carbon footprint than for other animals. Plus, most cats prefer fish to beef or corn, which is</p>    
               <p>better for the environment. You can feel good about owning your kitty.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="catpoints-li">
                <h3>Cats can help reduce stress</h3>
                <p>We all get stressed out, and people have many different ways of relieving their stress. Cat owners can </p>
                <p>reduce tensions by just stroking their furry friend’s head. Petting a cat releases endorphins into the</p>
                <p>brain, which makes you happier. Also, cats have the softest fur!</p>
